Knowledge gathered by one is not truly knowledge; sharing it with others makes it so.

While I have been reading books and papers on various topics over my life, I rarely had a chance to share and discuss what I learnt with others. Through this blog, I will share some of the knowledge I come across, and hopefully discuss them with the readers here.

For the near future, most of the posts will be book reviews. There is no real trend or topic that I specficlly read about, so the topic will vary widely with each post. However, a [future reading list] will be updated as I go through the books that I have.

As time avails, I also hope to expand the scope of this blog to discussing specific papers, or specific areas of Physics that I am currently reading into. I have tried to have a go at these at one point, but realised that they are must tougher than I expected them to do, and much more time-consuming.
