Review
======
Despite the seemingly overly-catching title, this book is one of the most informative and at the same time heavily emotional books I have read in a long time. In it, the author attempts to present the 10 different types of human nature that he has identified through decades of work in human rights, literature reviews of scientific work in social psychology and soccial neuroscience, and personal interactions with survivors of true hell on earth.

Each chapter starts off with a hard-hitting question related to one of the specific types of human that he has identified. Not something like the trolley question, which is relatively impersonal; but realistic scenarios based on real tales which resonate on a much personal level. He then explains our answer (which is likely to be in the majority) in two ways: by invoking scientific studies which looked specifcally into the category of huamn nature identified, and by recounting the life stories that he has interviewed.

The scientific portions are, in my opinion, extremely well-simplified explanations of many ground-breaking papers and experiments in the field of social psychology and neuroscience. The author even manages to do what so many scientists find so hard: discusses the results and the implications in a way that is followable by normal human beings. In this sense, this book presents a succint but informative introduction into those two fields in a very understandable manner. The findings and conclusions of these studies were very surprising and interesting for me; their consequences far-fetched and important in understanding how the human has come to be the way it is today, so different yet having so many commonalities with other animals that we know of.

The biographical sections are the really emotional and beautifully haunting side of this book, which is what really captivated me and got me to continue reading into precious lab time. The people in the book are introduced and described at a very personal level, to the extent that you can exactly picture what that person must be like in real life. Some of them are kind and easy-going; some under torment and in perpetual hell, but all people who are too real to have suffered and suffering through events in life. Their stories, brilliantly replicated by the author in writing, tells the tales of regular people, not heroes, who make irrational decisions. Decisions in terrifying situations, which would seem irrational for survival and reproduction, and perhaps expose the true nature of how the human brain operates. Their stories still haunts me and yet gives me hope so many days after reading about them; that is the extent of how real they are and how profoundly the life stories of these unknown, normal people have impacted my life.

Through this all, the interweaving between scientific content and the retelling of personal stories that the author presents is extremely well done. The focus, which is to show that humans can and do exhibit these 10 different types of human nature, is always kept in mind throughout each chapter, each scientific discussion, each part of the story told.

All in all, an extremely intriguing and informative book. I would really recommend a read if you're interested in finding out more about how humans came to be, why we came to be this way, and where we can go forward from here.
