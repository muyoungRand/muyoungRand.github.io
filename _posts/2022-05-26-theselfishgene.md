Review
======
Richard Dawkin presents, in this relatively short book, the orthodox Neo-Darwinian evolution and natural selection: a survival of the fittest between small parts of DNA. This theory suggests that natural selection does not work at the abstract levels of groups of organisms (like an embarrassement of pandas being 'selected' over another embarrassment) or at individual organisms (a single panda winning over other pandas); but rather individual genes through their phenotypic effects on the world.

While the idea does sound absurd (at least it did to me), the arguments presented in this book convincingly tells the story of why this would be a more likely level of natural selection that what we normally think of. Why do living things generally exhibit selfish behaviour? Why are mothers more often observed in natural to take care of children rather than fathers? Are bees, killing themselves in the process of stining an intruder, truly altruistic in their behaviour? If you are intrigued in any of these questions are wish to find answers, this book is a must-read for you.

There are many reflective points one thinks about upon finishing the book as well. Mainly, the question of whether humans are distinct at all from other animals, and whether the knowledge and undestanding of natural selection would allow humans to do better than what would be possible through natural selection alone. Can culture truly drive us from the conclusions of natural selection, and allow us the capacity to perform truly altruistic acts without a selfish motive? Henry Dexter's book that I reviewed before this says yes, but this book teaches us another way of approaching the question.

As a scientist, Dawkins also sets a great example for what we are typically told to do in a science communication point of view. The first few chapters are dedicated to talk about the units of natural selection themselves: genes. How did they come by? Why are they so common? Why would they form the basis of natural selection? He then goes on to talk about different behaviours that are observed in organisms, and how they can be interpreted using this 'selfish gene' theory. While in some chapters he does talk about selection at the level of individual beings for simplicity, he always brings the argument back to the level of individual genes, thus ensuring that the main idea behind the book stays present and at the forefront to the readers.

Another thing that I have come to appreciate about this book is this feeling that Dawkins' imparts on the readers: that we are truly learning as we go along the book. This book is by no means an easy book to read. It requires quite a bit of thought, imagination, and sometimes calculations by the reader to come to the same conclusion as the author. However, I have felt that as I went later and later onto the book, Dawkins somehow has a good idea of how much of the topic I am truly understanding; based on which he futher explains in detail some parts of his argument, and other, previously touched parts being skimmed over in brief. Perhaps this is because I am not a biologist and only have a vague understanding of natural selection. However, the pace at which this book was written and is read is astonishingly matching my own pace of understanding.

In conclusion, a really amazing read that has opened my eyes to another way of understand why living things are the way they are. Definitely worth a read!
