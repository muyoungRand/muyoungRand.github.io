Recommendation
------
More of a niche read for those who are interested in the history of mankind and how chickens played an important part of it.


Summary
======
What do you think of when you hear the word 'chicken'? To most people, it would invoke thoughts of chicken breast, chicken thigh, and of course, the egg, all of which are food eaten almost daily troday. Some might think about the white chickens we see in infamous videos showing the atroscious conditions that the animals now live in. Few, however, will think of the red fowl, the ancestor of the chicken that we know of. But chickens have a far more deep relationship with mankind that some may think. Walk around a chapel, and you may note a figure of a cock at the top of churches. Tune into award shows on television, and some of the trophies may feature the chicken. More frequently, you might be accused of 'chickening out' or being 'cocky'. The relationship between chickens and humans is one full of surprises and yet familiarities, which is the main theme of exploration in this book; some of the more interesting points I learned are summarised below.

Chickens were not among the earliest animals to be domesticated; in fact, it is still a mystery as to why the wild red fowl was domesticated in the first place, given that they are extremely skittish (they are so wary of humans that if approached in captivity, they sometimes kill themselves trying to escape), quite small and only laid around 6 eggs a year. However, once domesticated in the early days of agriculture, their crows which heralded sunrise quickly proved useful for workers, and gave the chicken religious significance. From the early Indus civilation, which posssibly domesticated the fowl first, it then travelled to Egypt and Ur, where the animal and the culture surrounding it then spread to other major early civilisations. Till today, the chicken holds a special role in certain religions around the world.

The story of human history is revealed through chickens as well. The Polynesians, who spread from South East Asia to halfway across the Pacific in Easter island, could not afford to carry aboard heavy animals such as cows and goats in their boats. With so little of their history written down, historians and archeologists now makes use of chicken carcasses, once treated with little respect, to understand how their people lived and functioned. One controversial finding that is still debated is the finding of chicken remains in South America dating to before the Europeans; implying that Polynesians may have been able to navigate the entire Pacific and have reached further than believed before.

Finally, there is the concern regarding the current state of affairs. While the terrible conditions that chickens are raised and killed in are inexcusable, the reality is that chickens have become such a large part of our diet that current production levels are absolutely necessary. Even more so given that chickens require the least amount of resources and releases the least greenhouse gases compared to other meat sources. Scientists and certain farmers are now trying to tackle these issues by studying various differnt space-efficient yet hopefully comfotable habitats to better the quality of life for such chickens. Others are tackling the issue by humanely bringing up other species of more natural chickens, in contrast to the modern chickens with codenames like Cobb 500. Supposedly they taste much better than the commercial chickens; I hope to try one someday.

Readability
======
As the book reveals, the history of the chicken is related to that of mankind. Accordingly, the author takes us on a journey through ancient history, from the civilisations of Indus, Mesopotamia, Babelion and more. In order to truly see how the fowl spread from South Asia to the Middle East and to Europe, I found it very useful to look up where these civilisations were located and when they were in existence as I went along with the book. 

While the later half of the book consists of chapters with a clear topic in mind, that cannot be said for the first half of the book. The first few chapters seem to be void of a topic individually, while together they attempt to tell a comprehensive story about the fowl's history. To do so, the author jumps between ancient history, science done a century ago, and modern research to try and tell this story in its entirety. Unfortunately, this did make me lost among the content a couple of times, which required some back-tracking and re-reading of certain sections in the book.

Personal Thoughts
======
I really enjoyed the book. Much history, economics and religion was discussed in the book, all of which I enjoyed learning about. There's not much to truly think about after reading the book, which perhaps is its only downfall; there is little to reflect on or reconsider with all the new knowledge in mind. One aspect of history that I am more interested in after this book is about the ancient civilisations themselves; specifically the Indus, Babylonian and Assur civilisations. The author did provide brief introductions to each of these civilisations, and all of them sound extremely unique with very different lifestyles as to what I have ever experienced or have read about.
